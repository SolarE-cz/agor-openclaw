## Workflow

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Confirm task scope and expected output.
- [ ] Create isolated Agor worktree and worker session for coding tasks.

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run project checks/tests (define once repo tooling is confirmed).
- [ ] Keep changes scoped to task intent.

### Opening PRs
- [ ] Attach PR URL to worktree metadata.
- [ ] Ensure CI/tests pass before requesting review.

## Common Patterns

### Orchestrator-first delegation
Create a new worktree and new session for implementation; keep this orchestrator session for coordination and memory updates.

## Things to Know

- This is the sole main repository for the Fluxion project as of bootstrap on 2026-02-19.
- Fill in build/test/CI commands once repository tooling is confirmed.
